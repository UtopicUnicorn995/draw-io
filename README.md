# Draw\.io Files Collection

This repository contains a collection of **Draw\.io (diagrams.net)** files that I have created or am currently working on. These diagrams are used for planning, designing, and documenting various projects. The files may include flowcharts, system architectures, database schemas, UI wireframes, and more.

## How to View the Files

1. Open [Draw.io (diagrams.net)](https://www.diagrams.net/).
2. Click **File > Open From** and select the `.drawio` file from this repository.
3. You can also use the **Draw\.io Desktop App** for offline viewing and editing.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding new Draw\.io files, improving existing diagrams, or updating this README.
